## My process
I started out with structuring my HTML, after which I got to styling.
As a beginner I spend 2 hours on this project, I was stuck in the styling part, on how to center a div, and 100% width takes in mobile design, thanks to the stack overflow that help me out.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
I learn about the flexbox design, and its uses in responsive designs.



### Continued development
I want to start focusing on working with grid, rather than flex


### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/ - This helped me to check out the best method to use for defining widths. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
